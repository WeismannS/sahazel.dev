## Introduction

After years of writing code and building projects, I finally decided to build my own blog site. Not just any blog — a minimal, fast, and developer-friendly platform where I could share my thoughts and document my journey.

In this post, I'll walk you through the tech stack I chose, the decisions I made along the way, and some lessons learned.

## The Tech Stack

Here's what powers this blog:

- **Next.js 16** - The React framework with App Router
- **TypeScript** - Type safety is non-negotiable
- **MDX** - Markdown with JSX components
- **Tailwind CSS** - Utility-first styling
- **Bun** - Fast JavaScript runtime and package manager

### Why Next.js? Why not Astro or 11ty?

People say it's overkill for a blog, and that's true. But it's overkill at no additional cost.

Setting up SSG with Next.js is just as easy as anywhere else. If it required a lot more engineering for no additional benefit, I wouldn't use it. But it's cheap to set up, and you're future-proofed for scaling into Next.js features beyond SSG if the project ever goes there.

The bundle size is maybe the biggest reason to go with something else — say, Astro. Next.js ships ~200-300KB of JavaScript (React runtime, hydration, client router) even for a static site. Astro ships a lot less — but let's be honest, there's a high chance you'll end up using React with Astro anyway for interactive bits (i know i would), plus their View Transitions client router (~50KB total). It's not as big as Next.js, but it's not zero either. Just food for thought.

Next.js pays an upfront tax — the React runtime, hydration layer, and client router ship on every page regardless of how much interactivity you actually need. For a static blog, that's overhead. But the upside is you're never limited — adding interactivity later is trivial because the infrastructure is already there. And if you need a component or library from the React ecosystem, you already have it. For example, I used shadcn's tooltip component — was it worth the 200KB Next.js tax just for a tooltip? No. But that's assuming the tooltip is the only thing I'll ever add, and it won't be.

**The practical reality:** the difference adds maybe 0.1 seconds on a 4G connection and then it would be cached. Nobody notices. Ship the thing.

```typescript
// Generating static paths for all blog posts
export async function generateStaticParams() {
    const posts = getAllPosts()
    return posts.map((post) => ({
        slug: post.slug,
    }))
}
```

### Why MDX?

MDX lets me write content in Markdown while embedding React components when needed. This is perfect for technical blog posts where I might want to include interactive examples or custom styling.

```mdx
## This is markdown

But I can also use <CustomComponent prop="value" /> inline!
```

## Project Structure

I organized my blog with a clean folder structure:

```md
content/
  blogs/
    Building-my-blog-site/
      index.mdx
      cover_image.jpg
lib/
  actions.ts    # Blog post utilities
  utils.ts      # Helper functions
app/
  blog/
    page.tsx        # Blog listing
    [slug]/
      page.tsx      # Individual post
```

Each blog post lives in its own folder under `content/blogs/`. This keeps assets organized and makes it easy to manage related files.

## Parsing Blog Posts

The magic happens in `lib/actions.ts`. Using `gray-matter`, I parse the MDX frontmatter to extract metadata:

```typescript
import matter from "gray-matter";
import fs from "fs";

export function getAllPosts() {
    const blogDir = path.join(process.cwd(), "content", "blogs");
    const dirs = fs.readdirSync(blogDir, { withFileTypes: true })
        .filter(dirent => dirent.isDirectory())
        .map(dirent => dirent.name);

    return dirs.map(dir => {
        const filePath = path.join(blogDir, dir, "index.mdx");
        const content = fs.readFileSync(filePath, 'utf8');
        const { data } = matter(content);
        
        return {
            slug: dir,
            title: data.title,
            date: formatDate(new Date(data.date)),
            // ... more fields
        };
    });
}
```

## Challenges I Faced

### 1. MDX Configuration

Getting MDX to work with Next.js 15 required some configuration tweaking. The `@next/mdx` package needed specific settings in `next.config.mjs`:

```javascript
import createMDX from '@next/mdx'

const withMDX = createMDX({
    extension: /\.mdx?$/,
    options: {
        remarkPlugins: [remarkGfm],
        rehypePlugins: [],
    },
})

export default withMDX(nextConfig)
```

### 2. Dynamic Imports

Loading MDX content dynamically required using async imports:

```typescript
const { default: Post } = await import(`@/content/blogs/${slug}/index.mdx`)
```

### 3. Reading Time Calculation

I added a simple reading time estimation based on word count:

```typescript
reading_time: content.split(' ').length < 200 
    ? 1 
    : Math.ceil(content.split(' ').length / 200)
```

## Styling with Tailwind

For the blog content, I used Tailwind's typography plugin with some customizations. The `prose` class handles most of the styling automatically:

```tsx
<div className="gh-content prose prose-invert max-w-none">
    <Post />
</div>
```

## What's Next?

This is just the beginning. Here are some features I'm planning to add:

- [X] Code syntax highlighting with themes
- [ ] Table of contents generation
- [ ] Related posts suggestions
- [ ] RSS feed
- [ ] Search functionality
- [ ] Comments with Giscus

## Conclusion

Building your own blog is a rewarding experience. You have complete control over the design, functionality, and content. While platforms like Medium or Dev.to are great, there's something special about owning your corner of the internet.

If you're a developer thinking about starting a blog, I'd encourage you to build your own. The skills you'll pick up along the way are invaluable, and you'll end up with something uniquely yours.
